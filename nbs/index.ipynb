    "### What is an event chain ?\n",
    "\n",
    "An **event chain** is basically like a series of dominoes, where knocking over the first one triggers the next one, and so on. In processes or systems, an \"event\" is something that happensâ€”a trigger, an action, a message, etc. Once this first event occurs, it sets off a chain reaction of other events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're at home and your doorbell rings. That's the first event. The ringing doorbell could trigger a series of other events:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your dog starts barking because of the doorbell.\n",
    "- You get up from your chair to see who it is.\n",
    "- You open the door and greet your friend.\n",
    "- You invite your friend inside.\n",
    "- You both sit down and start talking.\n",
    "- Each of these actions is an event, and they're all connected. The doorbell ringing set off a \"chain\" of events, one leading to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "In business or computer systems, understanding event chains can be crucial for analyzing how actions and reactions are interconnected. Knowing how one event affects the next helps you design better processes, make systems more efficient, or find out where things might go wrong."
